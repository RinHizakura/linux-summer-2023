     * arranged in a ring. Each thread will hold a lock first, and also tries to
     * acquire the next lock in the ring. When it acquires the next lock, it
     * drops the previous lock. Then it tries to acquire the next next lock, and
     * so on.

     * two locks and so make progress; in doing so, it releases a lock allowing
